issues: 

1. color, orientation, and size of scene show diversity
2. background of scene may be complicated, texture on background is difficult to distinguish from real textures
3. interference factors in natural scene (noise, distortion, unbalanced info)

survey of approaches
1. two-step approaches: handle text detection and text recognition separately
2. end-to-end approaches: handle two modules simultaneously, allow a shared feature map

Scene Text Detection and DL
- regression-based scene text detection
